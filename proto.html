        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a motivated and enthusiastic Machine Learning learner with a strong interest
            in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring
            how data, algorithms, and models can be combined to make meaningful predictions
            and intelligent decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have hands-on experience working on machine learning projects such as earthquake
            prediction using historical seismic data and early disease detection using X-ray
            images. Through these projects, I gained practical knowledge in data preprocessing,
            feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have completed professional courses in Python from IBM and Java from Scaler,
            which strengthened my programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
            I am eager to continue learning, improving my technical abilities, and contributing
            to impactful projects in the field of Machine Learning and software development.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Developed a machine learning model to predict earthquakes based on historical
            seismic data. The project involved data cleaning, feature selection, and model
            evaluation to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
        </p>

        <h3>Disease Detection Using X-ray Images</h3>
        <p>
            Built a medical imaging solution to detect diseases at an early stage using X-ray
            images. The system used multi-label classification and multi-mapping techniques
            to identify multiple diseases from a single image, improving diagnostic efficiency.
