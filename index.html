        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p> I am a motivated and enthusiastic Machine Learning learner with a strong interest
            in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring
            how data, algorithms, and models can be combined to make meaningful predictions
            and intelligent decisions.

        <h3>MY PROJECTS</h3>
        <h4>1.Earthquake Prediction USing MAchine LEarning</h4>
        <p> Developed a machine learning model to predict earthquakes based on historical
            seismic data. The project involved data cleaning, feature selection, and model
            evaluation to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
        </p>
        <h4>2.Disease Detection Using X-ray Images</h4>
        <p> Built a medical imaging solution to detect diseases at an early stage using X-ray
            images. The system used multi-label classification and multi-mapping techniques
            to identify multiple diseases from a single image, improving diagnostic efficiency.
